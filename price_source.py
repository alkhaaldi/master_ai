The rule this exists to enforce: a number is never returned bare. It arrives
with the time it was measured and an honest label, or it does not arrive.

state:
    live    - a real quote with a timestamp we trust
    stale   - the last value we ever stored, with the time it was stored
    missing - we do not know, and we will not pretend. values are None.

A value with no as_of is `missing` whatever its number. That is the whole point:
-2.51% P&L was published for months on a 134-day-old price because the number
arrived without its date.

combine() carries the composition rule: when two numbers of different vintage
meet, the result takes the WORST state and the OLDEST as_of. A live price times
a four-month-old volume is a four-month-old answer, and saying otherwise is how
a stale figure gets laundered into a fresh-looking one.
